    <p> Joanne Rowling was born on 31 July 1965 in Yate, Gloucestershire. As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories which she frequently read to her sister.
        
        As a child, Rowling attended St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More.Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the Harry Potter headmaster Albus Dumbledore.She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother worked in the science department.Steve Eddy, her first secondary school English teacher, remembers her as "not exceptional" but "one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English".Rowling took A-levels in English, French and German, achieving two As and a B and was head girl.

Rowling earned a BA in French and Classics at the University of Exeter. Martin Sorrell, a French professor at Exeter, remembers "a quietly competent student, with a denim jacket and dark hair, who, in academic terms, gave the appearance of doing what was necessary"</p></section>
